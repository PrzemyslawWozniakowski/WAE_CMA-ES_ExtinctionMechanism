ABSTRACT = {Extinction has been frequently studied by evolutionary biologists and is shown to play a significant role in evolution. The genetic algorithm (GA), one of popular evolutionary algorithms, has been based on key concepts in natural evolution such as selection, crossover, and mutation. Although GA has been widely studied and implemented in many fields, little work has been done to enhance the performance of GA through extinction. In this research, we propose stagnation-driven extinction protocol for genetic algorithm (SDEP-GA), a novel algorithm inspired by the extinction phenomenon in nature, to enhance the performance of classical GA. Experimental results on various benchmark test functions and their comparative analysis indicate the effectiveness of SDEP-GA in terms of avoiding stagnation in the evolution process.},
